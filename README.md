# Action Chance

Having played several D&D games at this point, one of the biggest pains in my ass has always been setting up initiative. Battles in general can be slow and when someone wants to hit someone else with their fancy Vorpal Sword, they first have to muddle through the red tape of setting up the battle.

At its core Action Chance is very simple: you add characters, you give them initiative, and you go through the list. What's nice is that *anyone* who's joined the battle can add characters, *anyone* can change initiative, and *anyone* can move the battle along. At its core, Action Chance was built to be utterly collaborative so that the DM doesn't have to ask all five players in a group what they got, they simply add it.

## Getting Started

If you already know the name of the room you want, go ahead and try to join. If a room name hasn't been used you'll instead create a new room for yourself and your friends. Room names are case sensitive so please keep that in mind!

### Adding characters

Click *Add Participant* at the bottom of the page.

Give the character a unique name, a portrait, and initiative.

You can add character portraits through URL links. Portraits will always be auto-centered so headshots are generally the best. Avoid tall pictures of your character because they'll probably be centered on the character's torso. Once added, that portrait will be saved in your browser for future use.

Initiative can be anything between zero and forty. Don’t worry if you forgot to do it, you can change this later!

### Battling

Every time you click the next button, the tracker will automatically move to the next person in initiative. If two or more characters are tied, one of them gets chosen randomly. You can add more participants in the middle of a battle and they'll be added to the proper place in initiative.

Players can add tags to the lower right corner of character cards. These tags are purposefully vague; it’s up to the players to decide what different tags mean. Clicking a tag that’s been added will remove it.

You can change a character’s initiative by clicking the initiative in the upper left corner of their card.

### Options

- From the options tab, players can change the background for the current room to any URL they desire (this gets saved to your browser just like the portraits). Small images make poor backgrounds so be sure to use something decently large and detailed! Players can also set a color filter that (hopefully) enhances the mood.

- Players can see their current room and switch to a different room from the connection tab.

- Players can also switch between using initiative and the more wildcard ‘Action Chance’ system in the gameplay tab.

## FAQ

- Q: What in the world is this no initiative thing?
- A: It’s an experimental feature. It determines turn order completely randomly and allows characters the chance to defer their actions until the next round. It’s more just for folks to play around with at this point.


- Q: I found a bug! What do I do?
- A: Let me know! You can find my email address either on my github or through whoever recommended you use this app!


- Q: I’ve got a suggestion! What do I do?
- A: Let me know! See how to contact me in the answer above!


- Q: Could you add more tags?
- A: Yes! I'm not great at making tags but I've used a lot of them from [Game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/) so if you see any you like let me know.


- Q: I'm a dev and I demand to know what this was built with!
- A: It’s built with ReactJS, Express, Socket.io, MongoDB, and a sprinkling of elbow grease :D
